I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I’m not as strong as I once was
When we’re together lately I don’t even feel a buzz
I’m addicted to this sh** like it was hard drugs
Nikki baby I love you but now I gotta go
Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I’m wondering what I’m paying for
All these other b*tches on my d*ck but I can’t f**k with that
You the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black
Tell me where you've been jack
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name Mary
I used to f**k her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that’s what I thought at first
Me and you together swear to god I saw that work
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years, goddamn took me as young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can’t fade that sh** I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this sh** you got me doing man it’s outrageous
All I know is I’m living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don’t get me wrong can’t forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go I always know you there
Tried to run but my legs won’t
I look away but my head don’t
I love it when you’re fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you
Nothing can replace you
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you’re everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don’t seem to understand
I’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you’re everything I crave
You’re the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I’m a king, you’re my Coretta
But lately I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine
Slave for the
Said I’m a slave for the nicotine
Been a slave for ya
I’m a muthaf**kin slave for ya
Slave for the nicotine
Nikki, Nikki slave for ya
I’m a slave for ya Nikki
I’m a muthaf**kin slave for ya
